        " \n",
        "YouTube, Amazon, Facebook and Instagram are some of the companies that use this kind of implemantation. This kind of project is the most commonly used Data Science application in the entire world. Some years ago, you would have to hire the best statisticians and mathematicians of the world to build a nice system. But nowadays with our advanced technology, anyone can build their own recommendation system.\n",

        "# Recommendation Engine Types\n",
        " \n",
        "There are basically three distinct types of reccomender systems:\n",
        " \n",
        "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
        " \n",
        "This filtering method is usually based on collecting and analyzing information on user’s behaviors, their activities or preferences and predicting what they will like based on the similarity with other users. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and thus it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an “understanding” of the item itself.\n",
        " \n",
        "## Content-Based Filtering\n",
        " \n",
        "These filtering methods are based on the description of an item and a profile of the user’s preferred choices. In a content-based recommendation system, keywords are used to describe the items; besides, a user profile is built to state the type of item this user likes.\n",
        " \n",
        "## Hybrid Recommendation Systems\n",
        " \n",
        "Recent research shows that combining collaborative and content-based recommendation can be more effective. Hybrid approaches can be implemented by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them. Further, by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach and vice versa; or by unifying the approaches into one model.\n",

        "## Scikit Surprise\n",
        " \n",
        "Surprise (stands for Simple Python Recommendation System Engine) is an easy-to-use Python scikit for recommender systems. This tool allows anyone to build Collaborative Filtering Reccomendation Engines easily using Python with few lines of code.\n",

        " \n",
        "The All in One Place is a company that offers streaming services, but their users average watching time is not enough for the CEO.\n",
        " \n",
        "Then he decided to hire me, a data science consultant, because he knew from friends that Data Science is helping many companies out there. I suggested to implement a Recommendation Engine into the platform, by doing this, the average time is going to get higher. \n",
