# Recommendation Engine

In this project, I built a Recommendation System able to predict whether a user is going to like the next movie. 

The main technology used here is the Surprise framework. This library makes the process of building recommendation systems easy.

This model was also deployed in Flask using HTML templates as Front-End with Ngrok keys to allow external machines to access the local application.

# How To Run the Script

It is very easy to run the script and test the interface.

1. You need Python to run the script. I used Python 3.8.3.

2. Create a folder to store the other folders and files. I recommend you to name it as "deploy" or "Deploy".

3. Create another folder inside it called "templates". If it is not "templates", the script will fail, so make sure it is right.

4. Put the index.html inside "templates".

5. Put .pkl file inside the main folder.

6. Put app.py inside the main folder.

7. Run the script.

8. Access the URL
